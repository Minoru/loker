Loker is a collection of programs to deal with UNIX Shell scripts.
It will include a parser, a static analysis tool and a compiler. The distinctive
feature of the project is strong compliance to the POSIX standard. All the parts
are written in Haskell.

At the moment the parser is almost complete and some work is being done on the
analysis tool and the compiler.

The plan is to make the first release soon.
